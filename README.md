# Digital Disclosure Service Store

This protected microservice is part of the Digital Disclosure Service. This service is designed to allow customers to tell HMRC about unpaid tax from previous years for both onshore and offshore liabilities. It is the replacement for the DO4SUB iForm which is the original digital incarnation of the Disclosure Service.

This microservice provides long term draft storage functionality via Mongo, such that customers can come back to the service after signing out and pick up where they left off.

## How to run the service

### Start a MongoDB instance

### Start the microservice
This service is written in Scala and Play, so needs at a JRE to run and a JDK for development. In order to run the application you need to have SBT installed. Then, it is enough to start the service with:
`sbt run`

### Accessing the service
